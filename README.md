# Automated Potato Peeler

For the Automated Potato Peeling device, this is an user interface. It displays the choices of the user to determine the slice pattern of the potato. A countdown timer displayed how long until the potaotoes are ready in which the user is prompt with an alert.  

Developement: This was a mid scale prototype so this was developed with hard code html5,css with bootstrap library and JavaScript (DOM Manipulation). No backend/database servers needed because the interface is not constantly changed/interactive.
